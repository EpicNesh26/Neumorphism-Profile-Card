A Neumorphic Profile Card created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a visually striking and interactive user interface component that combines the modern aesthetics of neumorphism with the functionality of a profile card. Neumorphism, characterized by soft shadows, subtle gradients, and a tactile feel, is seamlessly integrated into the design to create a visually pleasing and engaging user experience.

# HTML Structure:
The structure begins with a standard HTML layout, encompassing elements such as a container div to hold the profile card, and nested divs to organize different sections such as the user's avatar, personal information, and social links. Text elements are utilized for displaying the user's name, title, and a brief bio.

# CSS Styling:
The CSS file defines the neumorphic styling, incorporating soft shadows, light gradients, and rounded corners. The color palette is carefully chosen to enhance the depth and realism of the design. Subtle hover effects are applied to create an interactive and responsive feel when users interact with the profile card.
