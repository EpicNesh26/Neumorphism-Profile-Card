# HTML Structure:
The structure begins with a standard HTML layout, encompassing elements such as a container div to hold the profile card, and nested divs to organize different sections such as the user's avatar, personal information, and social links. Text elements are utilized for displaying the user's name, title, and a brief bio.




# CSS Styling:
The CSS file defines the neumorphic styling, incorporating soft shadows, light gradients, and rounded corners. The color palette is carefully chosen to enhance the depth and realism of the design. Subtle hover effects are applied to create an interactive and responsive feel when users interact with the profile card.



# JavaScript Interactivity:
JavaScript is employed to enhance interactivity. For instance, a hover effect may trigger additional animations or display more information. In this example, JavaScript is used to redirect a person to specific pages / sites on clicking the different icons .
